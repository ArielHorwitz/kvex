# Kvex

Kvex (pronounced "Kay-vex") is a [Kivy](https://kivy.org/) extension for desktop
applications.

Documentation is available via the [MouseFox project](https://ariel.ninja/mousefox).

## Features
Kivy is arguably the best GUI framework for Python, and the list of things that can be
improved is short. Keeping this in mind, Kvex does not intend to "improve" Kivy but
rather make it more convenient to use programatically, in particular for desktop
applications.

* Convenient API for programmatic use
* Theming


## Limitations
* Rather inconsiderate of Kivy's *kvlang*
